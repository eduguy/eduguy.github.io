      <div class = "description" id = "descriptionLeft"> 
        <p> I am a second year student at the <b>University of British Columbia</b> in 
          the <b>Computer Science (BSc) </b> program. I am not focused on any specific segment 
          of the CS fields yet, but am enthusiastic to learn more about everything as I develop 
          my skills. </p>
        <p> <b>Skills at a glance: </b></p>
        <ul>
          <li> HTML/CSS, currently learning Javascript</li>
          <li> Java </li>
          <li> C++</li>

        <p> Outside of work, my personal interests include:
        <ul> 
          <li> Mountain Biking: Living in the pacific northwest means access
            to the best bike trails in the world. Mountain biking has been something
            I've been into for many years now. I love the challenge of navigating technical
            terrain on a bike.
             </li>
          <li> Rock Climbing: With our proximity to Squamish, BC, I have access to
            the premier outdoor climbing area in Canada. I also enjoy indoor rock climbing.
            I really enjoy the problem solving aspect of finding the optimal way up the wall,
            while pushing your physical limits.
          </thead></li>
        </ul>
        With so much of my work being done inside, on a computer, it's critically 
        important to me to spend time in the outdoors in nature. </p>

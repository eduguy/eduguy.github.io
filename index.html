      <h1> Hi. My name is Ethan Lee. </h1>

      <div id = "description"> 
        
        <p> I am a second year student at UBC in the Bachelors of Computer Science program. Currently, I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, and C++. Right now, I don't have any specific focus in the computer science field, but am enthsiastic to learn more about everything as I develop my skills. I also plan to learn Javascript in the near future to augment my skills.</p>
      
      <p> Outside of work, my hobbies include mountain biking and rock climbing. With so much of my work being done inside, on a computer, it's critically important to me to spend time in the outdoors in nature. </p>
